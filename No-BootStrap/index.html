        <p class="bio"> I was born and raised on the south side of Chicago.
            I've lived all over the city and have enojed the endless variety of all it's neighborhoods. Even though
            I've always lived in Chicago, I am still able to find new and exciting things to do! <br /><br /> Recently,
            I have begun a journey to becoming a web developer. You're actually looking at one of my first projects
            right now! This is only the beginning, and I cannot wait for all of the amazing skills I am going to learn.
