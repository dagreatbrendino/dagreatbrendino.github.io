            I was born and raised on the south side of Chicago. I've lived all over the city and have enojed the endless variety of all it's neighborhoods. Even though I've always
            lived in Chicago, I am still able to find new and exciting things to do! <br /><br />
            Recently, I have begun a journey to becoming a web developer. You're actually looking at 
            one of my first projects right now! This is only the beginning, and I cannot wait for all of the amazing skills I am going to learn.
